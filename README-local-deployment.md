### Testing AetherOnRamp 

1 - To test AetherOnRamp we are creating 2 additional branches. 

The branch gnb-sim-testing is used for testing the emulated RAN.
The branch physical-ran-testing is used for testing the Physical RAN.

Any future work on testing either using Physical RAN and emulated RAN must be done in their respective branches.
